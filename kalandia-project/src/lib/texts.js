  Natural silk and other high-quality fabrics are used to create pieces
  that embody a balance between transparency and texture, lightness and
  structure. Each piece carries a philosophical meaning and emotional
  depth, transforming garments into stories about time, space, and the
  inner world of the wearer. Aesthetic value is seamlessly combined with
  meticulous attention to quality: every detail is carefully considered
  and perfected. Transparent layers, minimalist silhouettes, and
  handcrafted finishes emphasize the uniqueness of each creation. The
  design process prioritizes minimizing waste by focusing on efficient
  material use and exceptional craftsmanship.

export const aboutText = `ABOUT LOLA`;

export const aboutLolaText = `<p>My fashion career began at the University of Culture and Arts in Kyiv, where I earned a degree in Fashion Design.
I then continued my studies in Berlin, completing both a bachelor's and master's degree in Fashion Design at HTW Berlin, gaining knowledge in design, technology, and marketing.
</p>
<br>
<p>During my studies, I interned at <i>Freya Dalsjö</i> in Copenhagen, where I deepened my understanding of conceptual design and high-fashion processes.</p>
<br>
<p>My work combines innovative technologies, refined materials, and conceptual ideas. A key project is <i>Dogma: perfect human</i>, presented at <i>Neo.Fashion</i> during Berlin Fashion Week, exploring the intersection of utilitarianism and high fashion by transforming industrial materials into artistic designer objects.</p>`;

export const aboutLolaText2 = `<p><b>Professional Philosophy</b></p>

<p>I aim to blur the boundaries between utility and high fashion, creating clothing that inspires, tells stories, and challenges established norms.
For me, fashion is a tool for dialogue about the past, present, and future, as well as art and functionality.</p>
<br>

I am open to new collaborations and always ready for exciting professional projects.`;

<p><b>"Dogma: perfect human"</b>— a collection where military belts, once used by soldiers, are integrated with refined silk fabrics. This is a philosophical
exploration of the existential nature of humanity through the harmony of utilitarian and sophisticated, traditional and innovative elements.</p>

<p>The core concept of the collection lies in merging objects with history into highly aesthetic design pieces.
Military belts bring elements of strength and survival, contrasting with silk fabrics that emphasize the fragility of human nature.
Space blankets, processed with thermal treatment and integrated into material textures, serve as a metaphor for human vulnerability and transience.</p>

The collection erases the boundary between utility and high fashion, transforming inventory objects into unique works of art while preserving a profound philosophical context.

<p><b>"RE:BIRTH ZP 91"</b>— this collection merges technology, recycling, and the concept of the body, drawing on the visual and social codes of Ukraine in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The project is fully realized through upcycling: all garments are created exclusively from used nylon tights, which function not only as a material but also as a structural and textural foundation for the entire collection.</p>
<p>The collection deliberately excludes traditional seams. All garment construction and surface formation were achieved using a textile welding machine (Stoffschweißmaschine), a heat-based device used for fusing textiles.
This technological approach redefines conventional garment-making methods and emphasizes the experimental nature of the project.</p>
The philosophical and visual concept of the collection is inspired by the atmosphere of the 1990s in the city of Zaporizhzhia — a period marked by transformation, instability, and the reconfiguration of identity.
At the core of the project lies the concept of the body and its interaction with secondary materials. The material undergoes a process of rebirth, transforming and adapting to the body, embodying the idea of material regeneration on both a physical and symbolic level.
<p>The collection explores the boundary between body and material, the organic and the industrial, vulnerability and resilience, proposing a new interpretation of sustainable fashion through the lenses of memory, technology, and corporeality.</p>`;
